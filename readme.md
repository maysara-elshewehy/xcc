# `xcc`

This project can be considered as the core of the rest of our projects at **xeerx**, this project provides alternative working mechanisms that are easy to understand, maintainable, and faster because everything written here is built on algorithms and mechanisms that are already the fastest.

> It is also important to know the following :

- Codes are working on different operating systems, compilers, and environments.

- Codes are always tested through unit tests and benchmarking.

- Development is done using C++ codes, and requires version 20 or higher.

- The project is still under development.

> **This is an individual project, so I always accept tips and contributions ❤️**

- #### Contents

  > The codes were divided into several sections, each section is concerned with containing all the elements associated with a specific concept that is identified by name to facilitate access and remember..
